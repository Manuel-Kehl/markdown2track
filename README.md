## About
This script has the purpose of converting files written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to the syntax of the well known [Trac Wiki](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracWiki).

It is an extension of the [markdown2trac.py](http://trac.edgewall.org/attachment/wiki/TracWiki/markdown2trac.py) Script that I found on edgewall.org.
So far I have added routines for converting setex style headers and images.
