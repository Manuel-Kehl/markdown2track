## About
This Script has the purpose of converting files written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to the syntax of the well known [Trac Wiki](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracWiki).

It is an extension of the "markdown2trac.py" Script that I found on [edgewall.org](http://trac.edgewall.org/attachment/wiki/TracWiki/markdown2trac.py).
So far I have added routines for converting setex style headers and images.
